## Summary

Various DPR calculations for summoned animals, including those with pack tactics, charge attacks, and pounce attacks.

## Setup

This repo depends on the repo at `ttbuilds/utils` being checked out to a sister directory called `utils`. That is, if cloning this repo to `<parent-directory>/conjure-animals`, then `utils` should be cloned to `<parent-directory>/utils`. 

## To Run

Before running the code in `conjure-animals.R` either set the working directory to `conjure-animals` (or whatever you called it) or open the project file `conjure-animals.Rproj` in RStudio (recommended), which will set the working directory for you.
